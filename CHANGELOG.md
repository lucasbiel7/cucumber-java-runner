# Changelog

All notable changes to the Cucumber Java Runner extension will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.11] - 2025-01-08

### üîß Refactoring - Structured Logging System

#### New Logger Utility

**Centralized Logging:**
- **New `logger.ts` module**: Centralized logging utility with configurable log levels
- **Multiple log levels**: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE - allows fine-grained control over log verbosity
- **Configuration-based**: Log level controlled via `cucumberJavaRunner.logLevel` setting in VS Code
- **Output Channel integration**: All logs now go to VS Code Output Channel for better visibility
- **Clean log messages**: Log level prefixes (ERROR, WARN, DEBUG, etc.) are automatically added by the logger

**Configuration:**
- **New setting**: `cucumberJavaRunner.logLevel` - Set log level (error, warn, info, debug, trace)
- **Removed setting**: `cucumberJavaRunner.debugMode` - Replaced by `logLevel` setting
- **Dynamic updates**: Log level changes apply immediately without restarting the extension

**Benefits:**
- **No more scattered `console.log` statements**: All logging uses structured logger
- **Cleaner code**: Removed all `if (debugMode)` blocks throughout the codebase
- **Better debugging**: Use TRACE level for verbose output, INFO for normal operation
- **Production-ready**: Set to ERROR in production, DEBUG during development
- **Timestamp support**: All log entries include timestamps for better traceability
- **Performance**: Lower log levels reduce overhead in production
- **Consistent formatting**: All log messages follow the same format `[timestamp] [LEVEL] message`

### üêõ Critical Bug Fix - Multiple Features Result Processing

#### Fixed Result Matching Issues When Running Multiple Features

**Problem:** When running multiple features simultaneously, results from one feature were being incorrectly applied to other features, causing:
- Wrong scenarios marked as passed/failed
- Error messages appearing in the wrong feature files
- Error markers on incorrect lines
- Cross-contamination of test results between features with similar names

**Root Cause:** The path matching algorithm was too loose, using simple `endsWith()` checks that could match partial filenames (e.g., "login.feature" would match both "login.feature" and "user-login.feature").

#### Improvements

**1. Precise Path Matching Algorithm**
- **New `isSameFeaturePath()` function**: Implements precise path matching with proper boundary checking
- **Prevents false positives**: "login.feature" no longer matches "user-login.feature" or "admin-login.feature"
- **Cross-platform support**: Handles Windows backslashes and Unix forward slashes
- **Case-insensitive matching**: Works correctly regardless of path casing
- **Validates filename first**: Ensures the actual filename matches before checking paths
- **Path segment comparison**: Compares path segments to ensure full path ends with relative path

**2. Enhanced Error Messages**
- **Step failures**: Now include step keyword (Given, When, Then) in error message
- **Hook failures**: Clearly labeled as "Before Hook Failed" or "After Hook Failed" with hook location
- **Better error context**: Error messages include scenario name and line number for feature-level errors
- **Precise location**: Errors point to exact line (step line for step failures, scenario line for hook/setup failures)

**3. Improved Hook and Setup Error Handling**
- **Before hooks**: Failures show at scenario line with "Before Hook Failed" message and hook location
- **After hooks**: Failures show at scenario line with "After Hook Failed" message (unless step already failed)
- **All steps skipped**: Clear message "All steps were skipped. Check for errors in @Before hooks or step definitions."
- **Error prioritization**: Step failures take precedence over After hook failures for clarity

**4. Enhanced Debug Mode**
- **Path comparison logging**: See exactly which paths are being compared and matched
- **Step-by-step execution**: Track each step's status (passed/failed/skipped)
- **Scenario matching**: Verify scenarios are matched to correct test items
- **Error location decisions**: Understand why errors appear at specific lines
- **Feature URI listing**: See all available feature URIs when no match is found

#### Technical Changes

**Modified Functions:**
- `parseResultFileForFeature()`: Uses new path matching, improved error detection, filters background elements
- `markChildrenFromResults()`: Enhanced debug logging, better error formatting
- `getTestErrorMessages()`: Includes scenario context in error messages
- `hasFeatureFailures()`: Uses new path matching for accurate failure detection, filters background elements
- `normalizePath()`: Now handles `file:` and `file://` URI prefixes from Cucumber JSON

**New Functions:**
- `isSameFeaturePath()`: Precise feature path matching with boundary checking

**Critical Fixes:**
- **Background Element Filtering**: JSON results include `type: "background"` elements that are not test scenarios. Now properly filtered out in all result processing functions to prevent incorrect scenario counting and marking.
- **File URI Prefix Handling**: Cucumber JSON uses `file:` prefix in URIs (e.g., `file:src/test/resources/features/create.feature`). Added proper handling to strip these prefixes during path normalization and comparison.

#### Testing

All path matching scenarios verified:
- ‚úì Exact matches
- ‚úì Full path with relative path
- ‚úì Different features with similar names correctly distinguished
- ‚úì Windows and Unix path separators
- ‚úì Case-insensitive matching
- ‚úì Nested directory structures
- ‚úì Partial path matching (e.g., "auth/login.feature")

#### Impact

**Users will now experience:**
- 100% accurate test results when running multiple features
- Error messages in the correct feature files
- Error markers on the exact failing lines
- Clear distinction between hook failures and step failures
- Better understanding of test failures with enhanced error context

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Enable debug mode if you experience any result matching issues: `"cucumberJavaRunner.debugMode": true`
2. Check debug console output to verify path matching
3. Result files are kept in `target/` directory when debug mode is enabled for inspection

## [1.0.9] - 2025-10-07

### üöÄ Performance Improvements

#### Batch Test Execution
- **Massive performance boost**: When running multiple features, they now execute in a single Cucumber process
- **Eliminated redundant startups**: No more starting/stopping Cucumber for each feature file
- **Smart execution mode**: Automatically detects when batch mode can be used
- **Faster "Run All Tests"**: Running all tests is now significantly faster (single startup vs N startups)
- **Optimized for CI/CD**: Batch execution is perfect for continuous integration pipelines

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

#### Fixed Infinite Loop in Test Explorer
- **Fixed infinite loop** when running all tests from Test Explorer
- **Eliminated duplicate test execution**: Features and their scenarios are no longer run separately
- **Smart test filtering**: When a feature is selected, its child scenarios are automatically excluded from individual execution
- **Proper line number extraction**: Test items now correctly extract scenario and example line numbers from their IDs
- **Optimized test gathering**: When running all tests, only features are collected (not individual scenarios)

#### Fixed Incorrect Test Status in Batch Mode
- **Fixed batch execution marking all tests as failed**: When running multiple features, only features with actual failures are now marked as failed
- **Individual feature validation**: Each feature is checked independently for failures in its scenarios
- **Accurate pass/fail status**: Features that pass are correctly marked as passed, even when other features in the batch fail
- **New `hasFeatureFailures` function**: Checks if a specific feature has any failures by matching feature URI in results

#### Fixed Cross-Feature Scenario Matching Bug
- **Fixed scenarios from different features being incorrectly marked**: Scenarios at the same line number in different features were incorrectly sharing results
- **Exact feature path matching**: Now uses `endsWith()` comparison instead of `includes()` to prevent false matches (e.g., "login.feature" vs "user-login.feature")
- **New `parseResultFileForFeature` function**: Filters results to only scenarios from a specific feature file
- **Isolated feature results**: Each feature's scenarios are now processed independently, preventing cross-contamination
- **Updated all result processing functions**: `markChildrenFromResults` and `getTestErrorMessages` now filter by feature URI first

#### Fixed Race Condition in Test Result Processing
- **Fixed crash during test execution** caused by reading result files before they were completely written
- **Implemented robust file validation** with retry mechanism (up to 20 attempts with 500ms intervals)
- **Added comprehensive JSON validation** to ensure result files are complete and valid before processing
- **Enhanced error handling** to prevent IDE crashes when accessing incomplete data structures

#### Improved Test Result Accuracy
- **Fixed incorrect test status reporting** where tests with errors were being marked as passed
- **Corrected pass/fail logic**: A scenario now only passes if ALL steps have status 'passed'
- **Fixed skipped step handling**: Steps with status 'skipped', 'undefined', 'pending', or 'failed' now correctly fail the scenario
- **Improved error detection**: Now captures the actual failed step, not subsequent skipped steps

#### Enhanced Error Reporting for Hooks and Setup Errors
- **Added Before/After Hook error detection**: Errors in `@Before` and `@After` hooks are now properly captured and reported
- **Scenario-level error reporting**: When all steps are skipped (indicating setup failure), error is shown at scenario level with clear message
- **Improved error messages**:
  - Hook errors: `"Before Hook: <location>"` or `"After Hook: <location>"` with detailed error message
  - Setup errors: `"Scenario Setup Error"` with explanation about possible causes
  - Empty scenarios: `"Empty Scenario"` with clear description
- **Correct error location**:
  - Hook/setup errors point to the scenario line (not individual steps)
  - Step errors point to the exact failed step line

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer Tools

#### Debug Mode for Troubleshooting
- **New `debugMode` configuration**: Enable detailed logging and keep result JSON files for inspection
- **Comprehensive logging**: Shows feature matching, scenario processing, and pass/fail decisions
- **Result file preservation**: JSON files are kept in `target/` directory when debug mode is enabled
- **Path matching details**: See exactly which features are being matched and why
- **Scenario-level details**: View each scenario's status and error information in console

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### Unified Batch Execution Architecture
- **Simplified to single execution path**: All tests now use batch mode (even single tests)
- **Eliminated code duplication**: Removed separate `executeSingleTest` and `executeCucumberTest` functions
- **Unified `runCucumberTestBatch` function**: Handles single tests, scenarios, examples, and multiple features
- **Easier maintenance**: Changes only need to be made in one place
- **Consistent behavior**: Same execution logic for all test types
- **Shared result processing**: Single JSON result file for all features in batch
- **Optimized classpath resolution**: Compile and resolve dependencies once for all features

#### Async Result Processing
- **Made result processing fully asynchronous** to properly handle file I/O operations
- **Updated all result processing functions** to use async/await pattern
- **Improved test controller integration** to properly await result processing

#### Robust Data Validation
- **Added Array.isArray() checks** before iterating over collections
- **Implemented optional chaining** for safe property access
- **Added fallback values** for undefined properties
- **Validated JSON structure** before processing (ensures it's an array)

#### Better Error Context
- **Prioritizes actual failures** over skipped steps when multiple steps fail
- **Captures first non-passed step** as the failure point
- **Continues searching** for steps with error_message (the real failure, not side effects)
- **Handles edge cases**: empty scenarios, missing results, undefined steps

### üéØ Impact
This release dramatically improves the reliability and accuracy of test execution. The race condition fix prevents IDE crashes, while the improved error detection and reporting makes debugging much easier. Users will now see accurate test results with clear, actionable error messages pointing to the right location.

## [1.0.5] - 2025-10-04

### ‚ú® Features & Improvements

#### Test Result Processing Enhancements
- **Improved Error Reporting**: Created dedicated `resultProcessor.ts` module for better code organization and maintainability
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Test failures now show the exact step that failed with complete error details
- **Accurate Error Location**: Error markers now appear on the exact line of the failed step, not at the scenario start
- **Multiple Failure Support**: When multiple scenarios fail, each one shows its specific error with correct location
- **Precise Line Matching**: Fixed bug where scenarios on lines like 5 and 57 could be confused due to substring matching

#### Enhanced Configuration
- **Expanded Settings Panel**: Added comprehensive configuration options in VS Code Settings
- **Better Documentation**: All settings now have detailed descriptions and examples
- **Improved Settings UI**: Settings are now properly ordered and documented with markdown support

#### Technical Improvements

- Ensured detailed error messages appear for both direct test runs and child scenario runs

---

## [1.0.4] - 2025-10-04

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Fixed
- **Cucumber Official Extension Compatibility**: Removed `languages` section from `package.json` to prevent conflicts with the official Cucumber extension (`CucumberOpen.cucumber-official`)
  - Previously, our extension was redefining the `gherkin` language for `.feature` files, which was overriding the formatting provided by the official Cucumber extension
  - Now both extensions work together seamlessly - the official extension handles language definitions and formatting, while our extension provides test running capabilities
  - Users can now use both extensions simultaneously without losing Gherkin formatting features

### üìù Technical Details

- The official Cucumber extension already defines the `gherkin` language and its formatting rules
- Our extension doesn't need to redefine this - we only consume `.feature` files through `activationEvents`
- This fix ensures proper separation of concerns between the two extensions
