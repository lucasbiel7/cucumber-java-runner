# Changelog

All notable changes to the Cucumber Java Runner extension will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-04

### üéâ Major Release

#### Added
- **Maven Compilation Before Tests**: Extension now runs `mvn clean compile test-compile` before resolving classpath to ensure project is up to date
- **Generated Sources Support**: Added support for `target/generated-sources/annotations` and `target/generated-sources/swagger/java/main` in classpath
- **Consistent Run & Debug**: Both run and debug modes now use the same programmatic approach with `noDebug` flag
- **Descriptive Session Names**: Run and debug sessions show meaningful names from feature content (e.g., "Cucumber: Add product to cart")
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback during Maven compilation and dependency resolution

#### Changed
- **Extension Name**: Renamed from "Cucumber Java Easy Runner" to "Cucumber Java Runner"
- **Command Prefix**: Changed all commands from `cucumberJavaEasyRunner.*` to `cucumberJavaRunner.*`
- **Run Execution**: Moved from terminal-based execution to VS Code Debug API (with `noDebug: true`)
- **Progress Messages**: Updated to "Compiling project and resolving dependencies..."

### Fixed
- Classpath resolution now includes all Maven dependencies (transitive + declared)
- Compilation happens before test execution, preventing stale class issues
- Consistent behavior between run and debug modes
