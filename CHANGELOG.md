# Changelog

All notable changes to the Cucumber Java Runner extension will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.3] - 2025-10-04

### üîß Code Quality & Infrastructure

#### Added
- **ESLint Configuration**: Added comprehensive ESLint setup with TypeScript support for better code quality
- **Auto Tag Release Workflow**: New GitHub Actions workflow that automatically creates version tags from package.json
- **Improved CI Pipeline**: Enhanced continuous integration with Node.js 20.x support

#### Changed
- **Code Quality Improvements**: Fixed multiple linting issues across the codebase
  - Removed unused parameters (e.g., `token` in CodeLens provider, `progress` in cucumber runner)
  - Improved error handling with proper type guards (`unknown` instead of `any`)
  - Replaced `let` with `const` where appropriate for better immutability
  - Added explicit type annotations for better type safety
  - Fixed variable shadowing issues (`fs` renamed to `fsModule`)
- **Better Error Messages**: Enhanced error handling with proper error message extraction
- **Cleaner Function Signatures**: Removed unused promise `reject` parameters

#### Fixed
- ESLint warnings throughout the codebase
- Type safety issues with error handling
- Unused variable and parameter warnings

### üöÄ Infrastructure Improvements

- CI workflow now uses Node.js 20.x exclusively
- Automated tag creation on version updates
- Streamlined release process with automatic tag management

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-04

### üéâ Major Release

#### Added
- **Maven Compilation Before Tests**: Extension now runs `mvn clean compile test-compile` before resolving classpath to ensure project is up to date
- **Generated Sources Support**: Added support for `target/generated-sources/annotations` and `target/generated-sources/swagger/java/main` in classpath
- **Consistent Run & Debug**: Both run and debug modes now use the same programmatic approach with `noDebug` flag
- **Descriptive Session Names**: Run and debug sessions show meaningful names from feature content (e.g., "Cucumber: Add product to cart")
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback during Maven compilation and dependency resolution

#### Changed
- **Extension Name**: Renamed from "Cucumber Java Easy Runner" to "Cucumber Java Runner"
- **Command Prefix**: Changed all commands from `cucumberJavaEasyRunner.*` to `cucumberJavaRunner.*`
- **Run Execution**: Moved from terminal-based execution to VS Code Debug API (with `noDebug: true`)
- **Progress Messages**: Updated to "Compiling project and resolving dependencies..."

### Fixed
- Classpath resolution now includes all Maven dependencies (transitive + declared)
- Compilation happens before test execution, preventing stale class issues
- Consistent behavior between run and debug modes

## [0.3.0] - 2025-01-03

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Refactoring

#### Added
- Modular architecture with single responsibility principle
- Separate modules:
  - `types.ts` - Type definitions
  - `featureParser.ts` - Feature file parsing
  - `mavenResolver.ts` - Maven dependency resolution
  - `testRunner.ts` - Test execution
  - `debugRunner.ts` - Debug execution
  - `testController.ts` - Test Explorer integration
  - `codeLensProvider.ts` - Inline run/debug buttons
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Comprehensive documentation

#### Changed
- Split 1300+ line `extension.ts` into 8 focused modules
- Improved maintainability and testability

---

## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-02

### Added
- Maven dependency resolution via `mvn dependency:build-classpath`
- Full classpath support including all JARs from `.m2/repository`
- Debug support with Java debugger integration
- Descriptive debug session names from feature content

### Changed
- Debug now resolves Maven classpath programmatically
- Added progress indicator during dependency resolution

---

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-01

### Initial Release

#### Features
- Run Cucumber tests from VS Code
- Test Explorer integration
- CodeLens support (optional)
- Run entire features, specific scenarios, or example rows
- Auto-detection of step definitions (glue path)
- IntelliJ-style execution with `io.cucumber.core.cli.Main`
- Context menu integration for `.feature` files
- Command palette support
